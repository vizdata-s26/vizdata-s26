    "text": "Option 1: Departmental server\nThis option is for students who prefer to get up and running quickly, with minimal frustration. There is absolutely nothing wrong with choosing this option. In fact, it’s the option I would recommend for most, if not all, of you. And note that this is not a forever commitment; at any point in the semester you can choose to install things locally and start using Option 2.\nStep 1: Access the server and launch a session\nThe Posit Workbench server has been set up for you to get up and running without installing and setting up software locally. You can access it https://rstudio.stat.duke.edu.\nNote that this requires Duke Net ID log in. Additionally, if you’re not on the DukeBlue network, you will need to connect to Duke’s VPN first, and then you can connect to the server and access Positron.\nLog in with your Duke Net ID, then click on New Session and select Positron. You might need to wait a bit (~30 seconds) for the session to launch, please be patient.\nOnce Positron has launched, go to the Console and type\n\n1 + 1\n\nR should return an answer: 2. You’re good to go to the next step!\nStep 2: Configure GitHub authentication\nBegin by creating a public private key pair using the credentials package, run the following line in the Console:\ncredentials::ssh_setup_github()\nThe function will first prompt you to create an SSH key pair if one does not already exist\n## No SSH key found. Generate one now? \n## \n## 1: Yes\n## 2: No\n## \n## Selection: \nSelect Yes by entering 1 and hitting enter. The key pair will be generated and the resulting public key will be printed,\n## Generating new RSA keyspair at: /home/guest/.ssh/id_rsa\n## Your public key:\n## \n##  ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC5KwynraqqA4O91nOBtyuJMhYoeCAroSv7yC/GTXcjXsBvgYAlL0PCurJP7uRFbvkUaoBvuaGohR1qDlYNNWzH5FBDqftY+o35otq88mhDUaOmCzuik+MCLGiS/hp2D+5imc1Vqjabvk3fexMr7qkHrJE04vB/ZzI0iZzoZ0zGIJSistNODhrt6jCK7OzPFb4/lGGDxp0+vaGKeXIQGGdUwvMUD+HyNqTgO+g7rcdgmnVMWhhLH8uNb7tpQwDbRQu1h4R+xHO9JMHxFUz2cX4Du6GaQXuYLX3p8X276Nl8CU/V2R4CbGMJwO0Z0jcY8CVUhYBOIJsuS1a5ttHSoLCx \nYou will then be prompted to enter this public key to GitHub, via the provided link, you can also select Yes here to have the function open a browser window directly to this page.\n## Please copy the line above to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/ssh/new\n## Would you like to open a browser now? \n## \n## 1: Yes\n## 2: No\n## \n## Selection:\nIf you are not logged into GitHub the website will ask you to do so, once logged in you should see the following form:\n\nYou should enter a meaningful name for the key and then copy and paste the entire public key\n\nOnce finished, you can click the green Add SSH key button. This key should now show in the list of GitHub SSH keys on https://github.com/settings/keys.\nStep 3: Introduce yourself to Git\nFinally, you need to configure your git so that Positron can communicate with GitHub. This requires two pieces of information: your name and email address.\nType the following lines of code in the console in Positron, filling in your name and the address associated with your GitHub account.\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  user.name = \"Your name\", \n  user.email = \"Email associated with your GitHub account\"\n)\nFor example, mine would be:\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  user.name = \"Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel\", \n  user.email = \"cetinkaya.mine@gmail.com\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nI used my gmail because that is the one I used to create my GitHub account. You should also be using the email address you used to create your GitHub account, it’s ok if it isn’t your Duke email. You can find this information at https://github.com/settings/profile under Public email.",

    "text": "Option 2: Local installation\nThis option is for students who prefer to install software locally and who are willing to put up with a bit up frustration at the setup stage in exchange for having a machine with a local setup you can use beyond this course. And note that this is not a forever commitment; at any point in the semester you can choose to abandon your local installation and continue on the departmental server using Option 1.\nStep 1: Dowload and install R\nFollow these steps if you do not already have R installed or you need to update your version.\n\nGo to https://cran.r-project.org/.\nDownload R 4.5.2 for your operating system.\nFollow the installation instructions.\n\nSteps for installing Python will be provided later in the course.\nStep 2: Dowload and install Positron\nFollow these steps if you do not already have Positron installed or you need to update your version.\n\nGo to https://positron.posit.co/download.html.\nAccept the license agreement by checking the box.\nDownload Positron Positron-2026.01.0-147 for your operating system.\nFollow the installation instructions.\n\nOnce you’ve installed R and Positron, launch Positron, go to the Console and type\n\n1 + 1\n\nR should return an answer: 2. You’re good to go to the next step!\nStep 3: Install Git\nFollow these steps if you do not already have Git installed. You can check if Git is already installed by opening a shell (e.g., Terminal) and typing which git and/or git --version.\n\nIf Git is installed, you will see the path to the Git executable and/or the version number. You’re good to go!\nIf not, you might see an error message indicating that the command is not found, e.g., git: command not found. Follow the steps below depending on your operating system:1\n\n\nmacOS:\nInstall the Xcode command line tools (not all of Xcode), which includes Git.\nGo to the shell and enter one of these commands to elicit an offer to install developer command line tools:\ngit --version\ngit config\nAccept the offer! Click on “Install”.\nHere’s another way to request this installation, more directly:\nxcode-select --install\nWe just happen to find this Git-based trigger apropos.\nNote also that, after upgrading macOS, you might need to re-do the above and/or re-agree to the Xcode license agreement. We have seen this cause the RStudio Git pane to disappear on a system where it was previously working. Use commands like those above to tickle Xcode into prompting you for what it needs, then restart RStudio.\nWindows:\nInstall Git for Windows, also known as msysgit or “Git Bash”, to get Git in addition to some other useful tools, such as the Bash shell. Yes, all those names are totally confusing, but you might encounter them elsewhere and I want you to be well-informed.\nWe like this because Git for Windows leaves the Git executable in a conventional location, which will help you and other programs, e.g. RStudio, find it and use it. This also supports a transition to more expert use, because the “Git Bash” shell will be useful as you venture outside of R/RStudio.\n\n\nNote: When asked about “Adjusting your PATH environment”, make sure to select “Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software”. Otherwise, we believe it is good to accept the defaults.\n\nAnother note: Positron for Windows prefers for Git to be installed below C:/Program Files and this appears to be the default. This implies, for example, that the Git executable on my Windows system is found at C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe. Unless you have specific reasons to otherwise, follow this convention.\nLinux:\nInstall Git via your distro’s package manager.\nUbuntu or Debian Linux:\nsudo apt-get install git\nFedora or RedHat Linux:\nsudo yum install git\nA comprehensive list for various Linux and Unix package managers can be found at https://git-scm.com/download/linux.\nStep 4: Configure GitHub authentication\nIf you’re using a local installation of Positron, HTTPS is usually easier to set up.\n\nIn your browser, log in to GitHub.\nIn Positron, in the Console, run usethis::create_github_token(). This takes you to a pre-filled form to create a new PAT (personal access token). Click Generate token. Then, copy this token. Important note – you won’t be able to see it again once you leave the page.\nThen, put your PAT into the local Git credential store by running gitcreds::gitcreds_set() in the Console in Positron. This will prompt you to enter your GitHub username and the PAT you just created. Paste it and hit Enter.\nStep 4: Introduce yourself to Git\nFinally, you need to configure your git so that Positron can communicate with GitHub. This requires two pieces of information: your name and email address.\nType the following lines of code in the console in Positron, filling in your name and the address associated with your GitHub account.\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  user.name = \"Your name\", \n  user.email = \"Email associated with your GitHub account\"\n)\nFor example, mine would be:\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  user.name = \"Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel\", \n  user.email = \"cetinkaya.mine@gmail.com\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nI used my gmail because that is the one I used to create my GitHub account. You should also be using the email address you used to create your GitHub account, it’s ok if it isn’t your Duke email.

Since publication, readers have raised concerns that the error bars in Figure 9 appear to be the letter “T.” Moreover, it has been noted that the authors state that “no datasets were generated or analyzed during the current study” which is contradictory to the study described. This therefore raises questions about the reliability of the underlying data and the article’s conclusions.\n\n\n\nSource: doi.org/10.1155/2022/9758123"

    "text": "Deliverables\nProposal\nYour proposal should include:\n\nA brief description of your dataset including its provenance (not simply TidyTuesday, but where they got the dataset from), dimensions, etc. (Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.)\nThe reason why you chose this dataset.\nThe two questions you want to answer.\nA plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).\nPeer review\nReviewer tasks\nEach team will review the proposal of one other team. The peer review will be completed during a lab. On the peer review day, teams will have access to the project repos of the team whose work they’re reviewing. Reviews should start by cloning the team’s repo, re-rendering it locally to make sure you can reproduce their work, and then adding an issue to their repo with your peer review feedback.\nThe reviewer / reviewee assignments are posted below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection\nReviewer\nReviewee\n\n\n\nLab 1\nThe Rchitects\nThe ggers\n\n\nLab 1\nData Divas\nThe Rchitects\n\n\nLab 1\nThe Plot Thickens\nData Divas\n\n\nLab 1\nThe Tidy Thursdays\nThe Plot Thickens\n\n\nLab 1\nThe Standard Deviants\nThe Tidy Thursdays\n\n\nLab 1\nThe ggers\nThe Standard Deviants\n\n\nLab 2\nteam-7\nplot-twist\n\n\nLab 2\nmean-girls\nteam-7\n\n\nLab 2\nteam-9\nmean-girls\n\n\nLab 2\nteam-10\nteam-9\n\n\nLab 2\neast-coast-11s\nteam-10\n\n\nLab 2\nteam-12\neast-coast-11s\n\n\nLab 2\nplot-twist\nteam-12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeams will develop the review together, with discussion among all team members, but only one team member will submit it as an issue on the project repo. To do so, go to the Issues tab, click on the green New issue button on the top right, and then click on the green Get started button for the issue template titled Peer review.\nThis will start a new issue with a peer review form that you can fill out. Make sure to update the introductory paragraph with your team name and the names of the team members participating in the review. Then, answer each of the questions in the spaces provided underneath them. You’re expected to be thorough in your review, but this doesn’t necessarily require lengthy responses.\nRemember, your goal is to help the team whose project proposal you’re reviewing. The team will not lose points because of issues you point out, as long as they address them before I review their proposals. You should be critical, but respectful in your review. Also remember that you will be evaluated on the quality of your review. So that’s an additional incentive to do a good job.\nReviewee tasks\nOnce you receive feedback from your peers, you should address them. You should do this by directly updating your proposal or making any other updates to your repo as needed. You can do these updates all in one commit or you can spread it across multiple commits. Regardless, in the last commit that addresses the peer review comments, you should use a keyword in your commit message that will close the peer review issues. These words are close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, and resolved and they need to be followed by the issue number (which you can find next to the issue title). So, your commit message can say something like “Finished updates based on peer review, fixes #1”.\nWrite-up\nYour write-up should consist of three parts:\n\nIntroduction (1-2 paragraphs): Brief introduction to the dataset. You may repeat some of the information about the dataset provided in the introduction to the dataset on the TidyTuesday repository, paraphrasing on your own terms. Imagine that your project is a standalone document and the grader has no prior knowledge of the dataset.\n\nQuestion 1: The title should relate to the question you’re answering.\n\nIntroduction (1-2 paragraphs): Introduction to the question and what parts of the dataset are necessary to answer the question. Also discuss why you’re interested in this question.\nApproach (1-2 paragraphs): Describe what types of plots you are going to make to address your question. For each plot, provide a clear explanation as to why this plot (e.g. boxplot, barplot, histogram, etc.) is best for providing the information you are asking about. The two plots should be of different types, and at least one of the two plots needs to use either color mapping or facets.\nAnalysis (2 figures, text/code comments as needed): In this section, provide the code that generates your plots. Use scale functions to provide nice axis labels and guides. You are welcome to use theme functions to customize the appearance of your plot, but you are not required to do so. All plots must be made with ggplot2. Do not use base R or lattice plotting functions.\nDiscussion (1-3 paragraphs): In the Discussion section, interpret the results of your analysis. Identify any trends revealed (or not revealed) by the plots. Speculate about why the data looks the way it does.\n\n\nQuestion 2: Same structure outlined for Question 1, but for your new question. And the title should relate to the question you’re answering.\n\nWe encourage you to be concise. A paragraph should typically not be longer than 5 sentences.\nYou are not required to perform any statistical tests in this project, but you may do so if you find it helpful to answer your question.\nPresentation\nYour presentation should generally follow the same structure as your write-up. Each team will have 5 minutes for their presentation, and each team member must speak (roughly equally) during this time. Your presentation will be created using Quarto, which allows you to write slides using the same Quarto structure you’re used to. There is a sample Quarto slide template in your repo you can edit to your heart’s desire to create your presentation. Roughly I recommend 1 slide for introduction, 2 slides for Question 1, ans 2 slides for Question 2. You can imagine spending roughly one minute on each slide. You should feel free to have more (or fewer) slides. Your evaluation will be based on your content, professionalism (including sticking to time), and your performance during the Q&A (question and answer). We don’t care how many slides you use to do this.\nWebsite\nEach of your projects will have a website that looks like https://vizdata-s26.github.io/project-1 (to be posted). You are not expected to change the styling of the website, but if you want to, you’ll need to edit the _quarto.yml file in your repo. Feel free to google your way around it or ask on the discussion forum / office hours!",

This means putting all of the content in the Quarto files provided, rendering them to obtain the output, and committing and pushing all files to your repository by the indicated deadlines. Your Quarto files (.qmd) and the resulting html files (.html) will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (as in, don’t change the Quarto file without also updating the rendered document!).\nAll results presented must have corresponding code. If you do calculations by hand instead of using R and then report the results from the calculations, you will not receive credit for those calculations. Any answers/results given without the corresponding R code that generated the result will not be considered. For example, if you’re reporting the number of observations in your dataset, don’t just write the number manually, use inline R code to calculate the number. All code reported in your final project document should work properly. Please do not include any extraneous code or code which produces error messages. Code which produces certain warnings and messages is acceptable, as long as you understand what the warnings mean. In such cases you can add warning: false and message: false in the relevant R chunks. Warnings that signal lifecycle changes (e.g., a function is deprecated and there’s a newer/better function out there) should generally be addressed by updating your code, not just by hiding the warning.",

This data frame should have three columns: enrolled, year, and percent, where percent is given as a number between 0 to 100.\n\n\n# add code here\n\n\nCreate a stacked bar chart where year is on the x-axis and percent enrolled is on the y-axis.

Also make sure that the order in which the colors show up in the bars as well as the legend labels match. Note: For this task you can either use red and black colors, or use an additional piece of software (e.g., Digital Color Meter on a Mac) to match the exact colors.\n\n\n# add code here\n\n\nPlace the percentages of “yes”s in the red portions of the bars and remove all axis elements by setting theme_void(). Hint: First calculate where on the y-axis the annotation should be placed and store those values in the data as a new column.\n\n\n# add code here\n\n\nAdd back the x-axis labels, but place them on top of the bars.\n\n\n# add code here\n\n\nMake the bars skinnier and increase the white space between them.\n\n\n# add code here\n\n\nThe original visualization in Figure 1 (a) features three bars of unequal he*ight. Presumably, this might indicate a larger population being represented, but we don’t have data on how much larger this population is. But we can eyeball that the bar for 1886 is roughly 25% taller than the bar for 1876 and the bar for 1896 is roughly 60% taller.

Some more guidelines below:\n\nYou should make sure your response properly cites all of the resources you use. I’m defining “use” to include “browse, read, get inspired by, or directly borrow snippets of code from”. You don’t need to worry about formal citations, it’s okay to make a list with links to your resources and provide a brief summary of how you used each one.\nFor this exercise, you’re asked to describe what your code does. If you write the code, it should be straightforward for you to describe it. If you borrow any code from outside resources, you need to understand what that code does, and describe it, in your own words. (This is important, you’re allowed to use found code, but you are not allowed to copy someone’s blog post or tutorial as your description of their code.)\nFinally, you should personalize the visualization with your own touch. You can do this in a myriad of ways, e.g., change colors, annotations, labels, etc. This change should be made to make the plot more like the original in some way. You need to explicitly call out what change you made and why you made it."

    "text": "Question 1\nCOVID survey - interpret. A survey was conducted on the attitudes and opinions towards COVID-19 vaccination held by medical and nursing students across the US. The data were collected by Pavan Shah, Giorgio Caturegli, Galen Shi, and Joshua Materi at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Huge thanks to Giorgio Caturegli for sharing the data with us! The following visualization was created based on the survey results.\nEach facet in the visualization represents a response-explanatory variable combination. The response variables are in the columns and the explanatory variables are in the rows of the grid. For each response variable the survey takers indicated their level of agreement with the given statement. The responses were on a Likert scale: 1 - Strongly Agree, 2 - Somewhat Agree , 3 - Neither Agree Nor Disagree, 4 - Somewhat Disagree, 5 - Strongly Disagree.\nWithin each facet the data are represented with points (indicating the mean Likert score) and error bars spanning from 10th to 90th percentiles of the values of the response variable for each level of the explanatory variable. The first row is the only exception to this. This row of panes is noted as “All”, meaning that the it’s the distribution of each of the response variables without conditioning on any of the explanatory variables.\nYour task for this question is to take a close look at this plot and interpret it. There is a lot going on here, which is customary for plots that go into scientific publications – they tend to be very information dense, for better or worse… As you interpret it, discuss if there are any results that agree or disagree with your intuition. There is a lot you can say, but we don’t need you to be exhaustive. Please provide three concrete examples."

    "text": "Question 2\nCOVID survey - reconstruct. In this exercise you will reconstruct the plot provided in Question 2. You can find the raw data in data/survey.csv. Additional information on the survey can be found in data/covid_survey.pdf.\n\nLoad the data using read_csv(). View the result and decide if any rows on top need to be skipped. If so, reload again with the skip argument. Print the dimensions of the resulting data frame with dim().\nNext, you’ll do a bit of data cleanup. Eliminate any rows where all values aside from response_id are missing; these do not contain any useful information. Hint: There are many ways you can do this. One succinct way is using a combination of filter() and if_any() or if_all(). But feel free to use whatever works for your intuition, just make sure you’re only eliminating rows where all values (not any values!) aside from response_id are missing. Print the dimensions of the resulting data frame with dim().\nRelabel the survey response values according to the information in data/covid_survey.pdf. Peeking at the plot you’re working towards reconstructing can also be helpful to identify how exactly to recode the variables. Print the dimensions of the resulting data frame with dim().\n\nexp_already_vax and exp_flu_vax: 0 - No, 1 - Yes\nexp_profession: 0 - Medical, 1 - Nursing\nexp_gender: 0 - Male, 1 - Female, 3 - Non-binary third gender, 4 - Prefer not to say\nexp_race: 1 - American Indian / Alaskan Native, 2 - Asian, 3 - Black / African American, 4 - Native Hawaiian / Other Pacific Islander, 5 - White\nexp_ethnicity: 1 - Hispanic / Latino, 2 - Non-Hispanic/Non-Latino\nexp_age_bin: 0 - &lt;20, 20 - 21-25, 25 - 26-30, 30 - &gt;30\n\nIn our data we have response variables (the ones that start with resp_: resp_safety, resp_confidence_science, resp_concern_safety, resp_feel_safe_at_work, resp_will_recommend, and resp_trust_info) and explanatory variables (the ones that start with exp_: exp_profession, exp_flu_vax, exp_gender, exp_race, exp_ethnicity, exp_age_bin, and exp_already_vax). For each response variable and each explanatory variable, we’re interested in how the values of the response variable change across values of the explanatory variable, so we calculate the 10th percentile, mean, and 90th percentile of each of the response variables for each level of each explanatory variable.\n\nThere are a variety of ways we can accomplish this. One of them is to pivot the data longer, twice (!), so that each row represents a combination of each response variable with explanatory variable and its level.\n\nWe provide you with the code for this task, you need to run the code and confirm that you get the same result. Make sure to print the resulting tibble to make comparison easier as you (and we!) check your work. Also write a sentence or two explaining what each pivot_longer() statement is doing in this code.\n\ncovid_survey_longer &lt;- covid_survey |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"exp_\"),\n    names_to = \"explanatory\",\n    values_to = \"explanatory_value\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(explanatory_value)) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"resp_\"),\n    names_to = \"response\",\n    values_to = \"response_value\"\n  )\ncovid_survey_longer\n# A tibble: 43,428 × 5\n   response_id explanatory    explanatory_value response                respon…¹\n         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;fct&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;                      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1           1 exp_profession Nursing           resp_safety                    5\n 2           1 exp_profession Nursing           resp_confidence_science        2\n 3           1 exp_profession Nursing           resp_concern_safety            2\n 4           1 exp_profession Nursing           resp_feel_safe_at_work         1\n 5           1 exp_profession Nursing           resp_will_recommend            1\n 6           1 exp_profession Nursing           resp_trust_info                1\n 7           1 exp_flu_vax    Yes               resp_safety                    5\n 8           1 exp_flu_vax    Yes               resp_confidence_science        2\n 9           1 exp_flu_vax    Yes               resp_concern_safety            2\n10           1 exp_flu_vax    Yes               resp_feel_safe_at_work         1\n# … with 43,418 more rows, and abbreviated variable name ¹​response_value\n\nGroup the data (covid_survey_longer) by explanatory, explanatory_value, and response, and then calculate the following summary statistics:\n\nmean: mean of the response_value\nlow: 10th percentile of the response_value\nhigh: 90th percentile of the response_value Name this new data frame covid_survey_summary_stats_by_group.

For example, labeller = labeller = labeller(explanatory = label_wrap_gen(15)) places a line break after 15 characters on the labels of the facets defined by the explanatory variable.\nDon’t worry about matching the exact color for the background of the facet labels. But, if you want to match, the color is gray90."

    "text": "Question 1\nForeign Connected PACs. Only American citizens (and immigrants with green cards) can contribute to federal politics, but the American divisions of foreign companies can form political action committees (PACs) and collect contributions from their American employees. (Source: https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2024).\nIn this exercise you will work with data from contributions to US political parties from foreign-connected PACs. The data is stored in CSV files in the data directory of your repository/project. There are 13 files, each for an election cycle between 2000 and 2024.\na. Load all the data at once and stack them on top of each other with a column indicating which year the data is from with a single call to read_csv().\nThe ultimate goal of this exercise is to (re)create some plots – surprise surprise! But there is a nontrivial amount of data wrangling and tidying that needs to happen before you can do that. Below are the steps you should follow so that you can obtain the necessary interim objects we will be looking for as we review your work.\nb. First, clean the names of the variables in the dataset with a new function from the janitor package: clean_names(). Then clean and transform the data such that you have something like the following at the end. Save the resulting data frame with a the name pac (don’t overwrite pac_raw) and print the top 10 rows of the result.\n# A tibble: 2,639 × 6\n    year pac_name_affiliate                    country_of_origin parent_company      dems repubs\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                                 &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  2000 7-Eleven                              Japan             Ito-Yokado          1500   7000\n 2  2000 ABB Group                             Switzerland       Asea Brown Boveri  17000  28500\n 3  2000 Accenture                             UK                Accenture plc      23000  52984\n 4  2000 ACE INA                               UK                ACE Group          12500  26000\n 5  2000 Acuson Corp (Siemens AG)              Germany           Siemens AG          2000      0\n 6  2000 Adtranz (DaimlerChrysler)             Germany           DaimlerChrysler AG 10000    500\n 7  2000 AE Staley Manufacturing (Tate & Lyle) UK                Tate & Lyle        10000  14000\n 8  2000 AEGON USA (AEGON NV)                  Netherlands       Aegon NV           10500  47750\n 9  2000 AIM Management Group                  UK                AMVESCAP           10000  15000\n10  2000 Air Liquide America                   France            L'Air Liquide SA       0      0\n# ℹ 2,629 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\nc. Then, pivot the data longer such that instead of dems and repubs columns you have a column called party with levels Democrat and Republican and another column called amount that contains the amount of contribution. Save the resulting data frame with a new name (don’t overwrite pac) and print the top 10 rows of the result.\nd. Then, For each election cycle (year) calculate the total amount of contributions to Democrat and Republican parties from PACs with country_of_origin UK. The resulting summary table should have two rows for each year of data, one for Democrat and one for Republican contributions. Save the resulting data frame with a new name (don’t overwrite the input data) and print the top 10 rows of the result.\ne. Then, recreate the following visualization. Hint: The points are filled plotting characters with color = \"white\" overlaid on the lines.\n\n\n\n\n\nf. Find the countries with the 10 highest number of contributions and create a similar plot as above, but this time with each of the top 10 countries in a separate facet. Hint: The exact plot to recreate is not shown, but the redacted and annotated version below should give you a good idea of what the final plot should look like.\n\n\n\n\n\ng. Describe in 2-3 sentences what you observe in terms of trends over time in the plot you created in the previous part. Make sure to compare across (election) years, parties, and countries."

The two datasets you’ll use are homeownership-rates.csv and recessions.csv, both of which are in the data folder of your repository in a subfolder called homeownership.\na. In a single pipeline, load the homeownership-rates.csv using read_csv(), and making sure the resulting data frame has variables called date (originally observation date) and homeownership_rate (originally RHORUSQ156N). In a separate pipeline, load the recessions.csv data and make sure variable names are snake_case.\nb. Create the following visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\nc. Identify recessions that happened during the time frame of the homeownership_rate dataset and report how many do and do not overlap with the time frame of the homeownership_rate dataset.\nd. Now recreate the following visualization. The shaded areas are recessions that happened during the time frame of the homeownership_rate dataset. Hint: The shaded areas are “behind” the line.\n\n\n\n\n\ne. Create a subset of the homeownership_rate dataset for data from 2020 to 2023 (inclusive). Add two columns: year and quarter. year is the year of the date and quarter takes the values Q1, Q2, Q3, or Q4 based on date. Hint: These are data from the US, where the fiscal year starts in January. The first three months of the year are Q1, the next three months are Q2, and so on.\nf. Create the following visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\ng. Finally, bring together your plots from part (d) and part (f) into a single figure where the quarterly plot is inset inside the larger plot with recessions to recreate the following visualization. Hint: You can use the inset_element() function from the patchwork package for this.\nNote that the visualization also has an annotation marking the date WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic (March 11, 2020). You should carefully calculate where to place this annotation on the x-axis based on the date variable in the data. The y-axis placement is up to you, but try to make it look similar to the plot below (exact match isn’t needed) and also make sure it does not overlap with any of the data points or lines in either plot. Then, include a 2-3 sentence description of how you decided where to place the annotation and how you implemented that decision. Feel free to augment your description with code snippets if you think that helps clarify your approach."

    "text": "Question 3\n“This episode of Bluey is called Relax”\nThe inspirations for this exercise are my favorite cartoon, Bluey, and the fact that I’m headed to Australia for a conference, ICOTS 12, in July 2026. Additionally, Monash University, in Australia, is home to a number of fantastic statisticians, including Professor Di Cook, whose work we’ll learn more about in the visual inference module, and Professor Rob J. Hyndman, who works on time series and forecasting.\nThe data come from Tourism Research Australia and are available in the data folder of your repo as holidays.csv.\nNote: In the land down under, Q1 is June-August, Q2 is September-November, Q3 is December-February, and Q4 is March-May. 🤯\na. Load the data and plot the number of trips on the y-axis for each Australian state over time on the x-axis (represented in quarters). Use separate lines to represent years and separate facets to represent states. Arrange the facets so that there is a shared x-axis labeled as Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. Use appropriate labels and titles to make the plot informative. In 2-3 sentences, comment on any trends the visualization uncovers, e.g., differences between states, differences between years within states, seasonal patterns within states, etc. Make sure to pay attention to figure aspect ratio as there are many states / facets!\nb. Create a subset of the data for Queensland (Bluey’s home state) and Tasmania only, and using this dataset (and a bunch of wrangling / transforming / summarizing as needed), recreate the following visualization displaying the relationship between the observer number of trips vs. the lagged number of trips in Queensland. Then explain in 2-3 sentences what the plot reveals about high and low tourism periods in Queensland and any seasonality you observe.\nSome important features of the plot to note:\n\nThe points are colored by quarter using the \"bluey\" color palette from the blueycolors package.\nThere are separate panels for each lag and these are labeled lag: 1, lag: 2, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc. Create the same plot as above, but this time for Tasmania, using the a different palette from the blueycolors package (not \"bluey\"). Then explain in 2-3 sentences what the plot reveals about high and low tourism periods in Tasmania and any seasonality you observe.\nd. Finally, create two ACF plots, one for each of the relationships you visualized and commented on in parts (c) and (d). Of course, first I need to tell you what an ACF plot is. An ACF plot (short for autocorrelation function plot) is a visualization that shows the correlation of a time series with its own lagged values over different time lags. It helps to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality in time series data by displaying how the current values of the series relate to its past values at various intervals. It distills the information in scatterplots like those you created in parts (c) and (d) into a more compact form. Below is the one for Queensland that you will recreate, and then you will create a similar one for Tasmania.\nSome important features of the plot to note:\n\nYou will first need to calculate the autocorrelations for lags 1 to 8 for the number of trips in Queensland. That is, correlation (cor()) between the number of trips and the number of trips lagged by 1 quarter, lagged by 2 quarters, etc., up to lagged by 8 quarters, and separately for Queensland and Tasmania.\nThen, you will plot these autocorrelations vs. lag (1 to 8) using points and lines. You can think of this as a lollipop plot, where the lollipops are vertical lines from 0 to the autocorrelation value at each lag, with a point at the top of each line.\nYou will also need to add a horizontal dotted line at y = 0 to indicate zero correlation.\n\nOnce you have both plots, comment in 2-3 sentences on any similarities and/or differences you observe between the two states in terms of autocorrelations at different lags and explicitly state what that reveals about seasonality and tourism patterns in each state."

    "text": "Ideas\nYour first task is to come up with a goal for your project. Here are a few ideas to help you get started thinking:\n\nPresent and visualize a technical topic in statistics or mathematics, e.g., Gradient descent, quadrature, autoregressive (AR) models, etc.\nBuild a Shiny app that that has an Instagram-like user interface for applying filters, except not filters but themes for ggplots.\nCreate an R package that provides functionality for a set of ggplot2 themes and/or color palettes.1\n\nBuild a generative art system.\nDo a deep dive into accessibility for data visualization and build a lesson plan for creating accessible visualizations with ggplot2, Quarto, and generally within the R ecosystem.\nCreate an interactive and/or animated spatio-temporal visualization on a topic of interest to you, e.g., redistricting, vaccination, voter suppression, etc.\nRecreate art pieces with ggplot2.\nMake a data visualization telling a story and convert it to an illustration, presenting both the computational and artistic piece side by side.\nBuild a dashboard with Quarto and R or Python.\nCreate a package that makes it easy to create data visualizations in a particular style.\nBuild a website that teaches a data visualization topic of your choice, along with code examples and assessment items.-\n\nAnd, of course, your project can be a about visualizing a dataset of interest to you (similar to your first project). The only rule about this dataset is that it can’t be from TidyTuesday. Beyond that, it should be something truly of interest to your team, and a dataset that allows for a deep exploration.\nMost importantly, be prepared to brainstorm a bunch of ideas and discard them until you settle on a topic that everyone in the team is happy with and feels like a good choice for showcasing what you’ve learned in the class and how you can use that to learn something new and implement for your project.",

    "text": "Deliverables\nProposal\nYour proposal should include:\n\nA one sentence description of your high-level goal (such as the ones listed under Ideas above.\n\nA one to two paragraph description of your goals, including your motivation. Depending on the focus of your project, the following might go in here.\n\nIf using particular dataset(s), a brief description of each dataset including the reason why you chose the particular dataset, its dataset, its dimensions and any other relevant metadata. (Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.)\nIf answering a particular research question, the question itself and the reason why you chose this question.\n\n\nA weekly “plan of attack” outlining your steps to complete your project and including the team member(s) assigned to that task.\nThe final organization of your project repository. This means describing the project organization in your proposal as well as implementing that organization in your repo. Create any folders needed and place a README.md in each folder explaining what goes in there.\nPeer review\nThe peer reviews will be completed during the lab sessions as indicated above. On those days teams will have access to the project repos of the teams whose work they’re reviewing. The first peer review will be of proposals and the second peer review will be of code and organization.\nReviewer tasks\nTeams will develop the review together, with discussion among all team members, but only one team member will submit it as an issue on the project repo. To do so, go to the Issues tab, click on the green New issue button on the top right, and then click on the green Get started button for the issue template titled Proposal peer review or Code peer review.\nThis will start a new issue with a peer review form that you can fill out. Make sure to update the introductory paragraph with your team name and the names of the team members participating in the review. Then, answer each of the questions in the spaces provided underneath them. You’re expected to be thorough in your review, but this doesn’t necessarily require lengthy responses.\nRemember, your goal is to help the team whose project you’re reviewing. The team will not lose points because of issues you point out, as long as they address them before I review their work. You should be critical, but respectful in your review. Also remember that you will be evaluated on the quality of your review. So that’s an additional incentive to do a good job.\nReviewee tasks\nOnce you receive feedback from your peers, you should address them. You should do this by directly updating your proposal or making any other updates to your repo as needed. You can do these updates all in one commit or you can spread it across multiple commits. Regardless, in the last commit that addresses the peer review comments, you should use a keyword in your commit message that will close the peer review issues. These words are close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, and resolved and they need to be followed by the issue number (which you can find next to the issue title). So, your commit message can say something like “Finished updates based on peer review, fixes #1”.\nPeer review assignments\nThe peer review assignments for proposal peer reviews will be posted here.\nThe peer review assignments for code peer reviews will also be posted here.\nWrite-up\nYour have a lot more freedom in how you structure your write-up for this project compared to Project 1. This also comes with responsibility. You should make sure you have a clear introduction and a clear conclusion. You should also have other interim section headings that help the reader. Your write-up should be somewhere between 1000 and 2000 words. There is no expectation that you get close to the upper limit, anywhere in that range is fine as long as you have clearly explained yourself. The limits are provided to help you, not to set stressful expectations.\nPresentation\nYour presentation should generally follow the same structure as your write-up. Each team will have 5 minutes for their presentation, and each team member must speak (roughly equally) during this time.\nYou should create your presentation in a reproducible way, e.g., using Quarto. However you don’t have to use a package that is designed specifically for slides. If you prefer to build a dashboard or a Shiny app or a website, that’s fine too. The only rule is that it’s built reproducibly using R.\nYour evaluation will be based on your content, professionalism (including sticking to time), and your performance during the Q&A (question and answer). We don’t care how many slides you use to do this.\nWebsite\nEach of your projects will have a website. You can use the same workflow as for your first project or create something different. For example, if your project is building a dashboard, you might consider making your write-up a tab on that dashboard. Or if it’s building a package, you might consider making your website using the pkgdown package. Feel free to google your way around it or ask in lab sessions, on the discussion forum, or office hours!",

(1 point)\nWrite-up (30 points)\n\nIntroduction: The introduction provides a clear explanation of the question and the dataset used to answer the question, including a description of all relevant variables in the dataset. (3 points)\nJustification of approach: The chosen approach and visualizations are clearly explained and justified. (3 points)\nCode: Code is correct, easy to read, properly formatted, and properly documented. (10 points)\nVisualization: The visualizations are appropriate, easy to read, and properly labeled. (10 points)\nDiscussion: Discussion of results is clear and correct, and it has some depth without begin excessively long. (4 points)\nReproducibility and organization (5 points)\n\nAll required files are provided. Quarto files render without issues and reproduce the necessary outputs. (2 points)\nData is in the data folder, with a codebook in the README, and is loaded from this folder in presentation and writeup. (1 points)\nDocuments are well structured and easy to follow. No extraneous materials. (1 points)\nAll issues are closed, mostly with specific commits addressing them. (1 points)\nCode style and smell (10 points)\n\nConsistent naming conventions: Variable names, functions, and data objects use clear, descriptive snake_case naming. Names reflect their purpose in the visualization (e.g., sales_by_region, not df1 or temp). (2 points)\nReadable formatting & spacing: Code follows tidyverse formatting conventions: consistent indentation, spaces around operators, line breaks for long pipelines, and one statement per line where appropriate. (2 points)\nEffective Use of the base pipe (|&gt;): Pipes are used to create clear, linear data transformation and visualization workflows. Pipelines are not overly long or deeply nested, and intermediate steps are understandable. (1 points)\nAvoidance of redundant or dead code: No unused variables, commented-out blocks, duplicated code, or unnecessary intermediate objects that suggest poor cleanup or experimentation left in the final submission. Where applicable, repeated logic (e.g., data cleaning or plotting patterns) is factored into functions that are short, focused, and named clearly, rather than copy-pasted. (2 points)\nClear and purposeful comments: Comments explain why a step exists rather than restating what the code does. Comments are used sparingly and are up to date with the code. (1 point)\nAvoidance of common code smells: Code avoids magic numbers, overly complex expressions, hard-coded paths, and deeply nested conditionals that reduce readability and flexibility.

    "text": "Guidelines\nPlease use the project repository that has been created for your team to complete your project. Everything should be done reproducibly. This means that I should be able to clone your repo and reproduce everything you’ve submitted as part of your project.\nAll results presented must have corresponding code. If you do calculations by hand instead of using R and then report the results from the calculations, you will not receive credit for those calculations. Any answers/results given without the corresponding R code that generated the result will not be considered. For example, if you’re reporting the number of observations in your dataset, don’t just write the number manually, use inline R code to calculate the number. All code reported in your final project document should work properly. Please do not include any extraneous code or code which produces error messages. Code which produces certain warnings and messages is acceptable, as long as you understand what the warnings mean. In such cases you can add warning: false and message: false in the relevant R chunks. Warnings that signal lifecycle changes (e.g., a function is deprecated and there’s a newer/better function out there) should generally be addressed by updating your code, not just by hiding the warning.",

Commit and push often, and ask questions when stuck.\nReview the marking guidelines below and ask questions if any of the expectations are unclear.\nMake sure each team member is contributing, both in terms of quality and quantity of contribution (we will be reviewing commits from different team members).\nSet aside time to work together and apart (physically).\n\nCode:\n\nIn your presentation your code should be hidden (echo: false) so that your slides are neat and easy to read. However your document should include all your code such that if I re-render your Quarto file I should be able to obtain the results you presented. Exception: If you want to highlight something specific about a piece of code, you’re welcomed to show that portion.\nIn your write-up your code should be visible.\n\n\nTeamwork: You are to complete the assignment as a team. All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of this assignment and team evaluations will be given at its completion - anyone judged to not have sufficiently contributed to the final product will have their grade penalized. While different team members may have different backgrounds and abilities, it is the responsibility of every team member to understand how and why all code and approaches in the assignment work.\nWhen you’re done, review the documents on GitHub to make sure you’re happy with the final state of your work.

Du Bois.\nThe seven-week challenge included 10 out of the 63 visualizations in the original exhibit. Each week, participants were tasked with recreating one of the visualizations and there were three “bonus” visualization challenges. People used social media to share their recreations side-by-side with the originals using the tag #DuBoisChallenge, and many shared the code they used for the recreation.\nThe challenge has been taking place annually in February since then, including this year!"

This includes:\n\nLoading and briefly exploring the data\nMaking decisions about what variables to use\nBuilding the plot iteratively with ggplot2\nCustomizing aesthetics, labels, scales, and themes\nAddressing any challenges or errors you encounter (don’t edit these out – they’re valuable learning moments!)\n\nWrap-up (~1-2 minutes): Show your final visualization and summarize what it reveals about the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYour video should not exceed 20 minutes.\n\n\nRecording tips:\n\nYou can use any screen recording software you like. Zoom is accessible to everyone via Duke’s Zoom account. Start a new meeting, share your screen, and click “Record” to begin. You can record to the cloud or locally on your computer. Alternatively, you can use QuickTime, OBS, Loom, or any other screen recording tool you’re comfortable with.\nMake sure your font size in Positron is large enough to be readable in the recording.\nSpeak clearly and narrate your thought process – pretend you’re teaching someone who is following along.\nIt’s okay to make mistakes and fix them on video; this is part of the learning experience. Do not edit out errors or challenges – showing how you troubleshoot is not only valuablae for your own learning but also for others who watch your video.\n\n\n\nBlog post\nWrite a short blog post (approximately a 5 minute read) that accompanies your video. Your blog post should include:\n\nIntroduction: A brief overview of the dataset and the question you set out to answer and why it interested you.\nThe visualization: Your final polished visualization.\nProcess highlights: Key decisions you made during the live-coding session, interesting challenges you encountered, and how you solved them. You don’t need to rehash everything from the video – focus on the most interesting or instructive moments.\nTakeaways: What did you learn from the data? What did you learn about the visualization process?\nReflection: What would you do differently if you had more time? Are there other aspects of the data you’d like to explore?\n\nThe blog post should be written in index.qmd in your repository.\n\n\nCode\nYour polished visualization code should be included in your blog post (in index.qmd) with echo: true so readers can see and learn from your code.",

Three themes (what, why, and how) will run alongside each other as we cycle through the course topics. In “what” we focus on specific types of visualizations for a particular purpose (e.g. maps for spatial data, Sankey diagrams for proportions, etc.) as well as the tooling to produce them (e.g. specific R packages). In “how” we focus on the process – each visualization starts with a design (which we’ll often ask you to do with a rough sketch accompanied by pseudo code), then often needs pre-processing of the data (wrangling, reshaping, joining, etc. to get it into a tidy, rectangular format for visualization), then attributes of the data are mapped to plot aesthetics, then the creator of the visualization needs to make a series of strategic decisions about visual encoding (e.g. accessibility concerns), and finally creating effective visualizations requires post-processing for visual appeal as well as annotation. In “why” we discuss the theory that ties the “how” and the “what” together, often focusing on the grammar of graphics. Like any data analysis, data visualization is also an iterative process. We don’t expect you to land on the perfect visualization on the first try, so we promote the iterative process via critical and constructive review of one’s own and each others’ work. Independent modules will also touch on topics such as using statistical graphics for visual inference, creating data-based art, and a review of the literature on non-visual approaches to representing data.\nThe course will primarily focus on the use of the R statistical programming language and introduce you to a variety of modern data visualization packages in R. The course will also introduce a few modern and popular visualization libraries for Python and teach you enough about Python to be able to create visualizations using these libraries.

Members of this community commit to reflect upon and uphold these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity. Duke University has high expectations for students’ scholarship and conduct. In accepting admission, students indicate their willingness to subscribe to and be governed by the rules and regulations of the university, which flow from the Duke Community Standard (DCS). Regardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including but not limited to the academic integrity policy (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the DCS. Students can direct any questions or concerns regarding academic integrity to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu and can access the DCS guide at https://dukecommunitystandard.students.duke.edu.\n\n\nInclusive community\nIt is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official Duke records, please let me know! You’ll be able to note this in the Getting to know you survey.\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.\n\n\n\nPronouns\nPronouns are meaningful tools to communicate identities and experiences, and using pronouns supports a campus environment where all community members can thrive. Please update your gender pronouns in Duke Hub. You can learn more at the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity’s website.\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website: vizdata.org.\nI will regularly send course announcements via email and Sakai, make sure to check one or the other of these regularly. If an announcement is sent Monday through Thursday, I will assume that you have read the announcement by the next day. If an announcement is sent on a Friday or over the weekend, I will assume that you have read it by Monday.\n\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIf you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nThe teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on Ed. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts on Ed before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question posted on Ed, I encourage you to respond!\n\nCheck out the Support page for more resources.\nI want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class. If this requires flexibility, please don’t hesitate to ask.\n\nYou never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you’re always welcome to talk to me. If I can’t help, I likely know someone who can.\nI want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.",

Please make sure your laptop is fully charged before you come to class as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone. See [Technology accommodations] if you need a loaner laptop.\nAttendance and participation are required throughout the semester.",

    "text": "Assessment\nAssessment for the course is comprised of four components: quizzes, homeworks, mini-projects, and projects.\n\nQuizzes: There will be 12-15 short quizzes to assess your understanding of the readings and lecture material. Quizzes will not be pre-announced and will take place on pseudo-random days during lecture or lab. Grading of quizzes will be based on attendance and correctness. Lowest 3-4 quizzes (roughly 25% dropped, depending on how many quizzes we end up with throughout the semester) will be dropped. There are no make-ups or late submissions for missed quizzes.\nHomeworks: There will be 6 homework assignments due every other week (roughly), completed individually. Homework assignments are due by 5 pm ET on the indicated day on the course schedule. Lowest homework assignment score is dropped.\nMini-projects: There will be 2 mini-projects, one in the first half of the semester and one in the second half, completed individually. The deliverables for each mini-project will include a video where you walk through your code and explain your process and findings as well as a short write-up (think 5-10 minute read blog post).\n\nMini-project 1: Live-code a visualization from scratch based on that week’s #TidyTuesday data and write a short blog post elevating main highlights and take-aways of the video and final product.\nMini-project 2: Create a video and write a short blog post on “visualizing X data”, where X is a dataset type of your choosing (e.g., network, hierarchical, text, etc.) that we will not explicitly cover in class.\n\nMore details on the requirements and expectations for each mini-project will be provided when the assignments are posted.\nProjects There will be 2 projects, one mid-semester and end of semester, completed in teams.\n\nProject 1: Teams will be given a dataset (or a set of datasets to choose from) to visualize.\nProject 2: Teams will choose the focus of their own project. One requirement is that you need to do something new.\n\nThe deliverables for each project will include data visualizations (duh!), a write up of the process and findings, and a presentation. For the second project, you will be encouraged to think beyond a traditional two-dimensional data visualization (e.g. interactive web apps/dashboards, data art, generative art, physical/tangible visualizations, ggplot2 extensions, other languages, etc.).\nEach project will have a peer review component to provide at least one round of feedback during the process of development. Teams will provide periodic peer feedback to their teammates while working on the projects as well as upon completion. The scores from the peer evaluations, along with individual contributions tracked by commits on GitHub, will be used to ensure that each student has contributed to the teamwork.\nAll team members must take part in the presentation. Presentations can be given in person in class, or via Zoom if the team prefers. My preference is that the team stick to one method of delivery (all presenters in person or all presenters on Zoom), but I realize a lot can change throughout this semester, and we’ll adjust accordingly.\nMore details on the requirements and expectations for each project will be provided when the assignments are posted.\n\nAll work is expected to be submitted by the deadline and there are no make-ups for any missed assessments. See the late work policy for more details.",

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:\n\nCollaboration: Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nThe homework assignments must also be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to lab questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nThe reading quizzes must be completed individually with absolutely no communication with classmates.\nFor the projects, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\nOn individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class.\n\nOnline resources: I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g., StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:1 (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning.\n\nEthical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n\n✅ AI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\n❌ AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments. In general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you.\n\nYou are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\nIf you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask a member of the teaching team.\nIt is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course will\n\nautomatically result in a 0 for the assignment,\ncan further impact your overall course grade, and\nwill be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for further action.\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline.\nPolicy on late work depends on the particular course component:\n\nQuizzes: Late quizzes are not accepted and there are no make ups for missed quizzes.\nHomeworks and mini-projects: GitHub repositories will be closed to contributions at the deadline. If you need to submit your work late, email the professor to reopen your repository.\n\nLate, within 24 hours of deadline: -10% of available points\nLate, within 24-48 hours of deadline: -20% of available points\nMore than 48 hours later: No credit, and we will not provide written feedback\n\nProjects: The following three components contribute to your project score.\n\nPresentation: Late presentations are not accepted and there are no make-ups for missed presentations.\nWrite up: GitHub repositories will be closed to contributions at the deadline. If you need to submit your work late, email the professor to reopen your repository.\n\nLate, within 24 hours of deadline: -10% of available points\nLate, within 24-48 hours of deadline: -20% of available points\nMore than 48 hours later: No credit, and we will not provide written feedback\n\nPeer evaluation: Late peer evaluations are not accepted and there are no make-ups for missed peer evaluations. If you do not turn in your peer evaluation, you get 0 points for your own peer score as well, regardless of how your teammates have evaluated you.\n\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a homework or a mini-project by the stated due date, you may email the professor before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance. Waivers cannot be used for quizzes or projects, they can only be applied to homeworks and mini-projects.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let me know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nRegrade requests must be made within one week of when the assignment is returned, and must be typed up and submitted in writing (hard copy) to the course instructor. These will be considered if points were tallied incorrectly or if you feel your answer is correct but it was marked wrong. No regrade will be made to alter the number of points deducted for a mistake. Note that during the regrade process your score could go up or go down or not change.\nNo regrade requests will be accepted after April 24, 2026.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nResponsibility for class attendance rests with individual students. Since regular and punctual class attendance is expected, students must accept the consequences of failure to attend. More details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.\nHowever, there may be many reasons why you cannot be in class on a given day, particularly with possible extra personal and academic stress and health concerns this semester. If you miss a lecture, make sure to to review the lecture material before the next class session. Lab time is dedicated to working on your homework assignments and collaborating with your teammates on your project. If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your team about how you can make up your contribution. Given the technologies we use in the course, this is straightforward to do asynchronously. If you know you’re going to miss a lab session and you’re feeling well enough to do so, notify your teammates ahead of time. Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others’ time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class.\nNote that attendance, as measured by quizzes, is part of your grade as well.\n\n\nLecture recording request policy\nLectures will be recorded on Panopto and will be made available to students with an excused absence upon request. Videos shared with such students will be available for a week after the lecture date. To request a particular lecture’s video, please fill out the form at the link below. Please submit the form within 24 hours of missing lecture to ensure you have sufficient time to watch the recording. Please also make sure that any official documentation, such as incapacitation forms, Dean’s excuses, NOVAPs, and religious observance notification forms are also uploaded to the form.\n🔗 https://forms.cloud.microsoft/r/P8LufRJakA\n\n\nInclement weather policy\nIn the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work. This might entail holding the class on Zoom synchronously or watching a recording of the class.\n\n\nPolicy on video recording course content\nIf you feel that you need record the lectures yourself, you must get permission from me ahead of time and these recordings should be used for personal study only, no for distribution. The full policy on recording of lectures falls under the Duke University Policy on Intellectual Property Rights, available at provost.duke.edu/sites/default/files/FHB_App_P.pdf. Unauthorized distribution is a cause for disciplinary action by the Judicial Board.",

SDAO will work with you to determine what accommodations are appropriate for your situation. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and disability accommodations cannot be provided until a Faculty Accommodation Letter has been given to me. Please contact SDAO for more information: sdao@duke.edu or access.duke.edu.\n\n\nReligious accommodations\nStudents are permitted by university policy to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday. Accordingly, Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and the Pratt School of Engineering have established procedures to be followed by students for notifying their instructors of an absence necessitated by the observance of a religious holiday. Please submit requests for religious accommodations at the beginning of the semester so that we can work to make suitable arrangements well ahead of time.
