# Accessibility and screen readers

## Alternative text

> It is read by screen readers in place of images allowing the content and function of the image to be accessible to those with visual or certain cognitive disabilities.
>
> It is displayed in place of the image in browsers if the image file is not loaded or when the user has chosen not to view images.
>
> It provides a semantic meaning and description to images which can be read by search engines or be used to later determine the content of the image from page context alone.

## The Four-Ingredients Model {.smaller}

Canelón and Hare (2021) developed four questions for writing alt text:

::: incremental
1. **What kind of graph or chart is it?**
   Beginning with chart type helps readers anticipate the information.

2. **What variables are on the axes?**
   Use actual variable names, not color descriptions. Research shows tracking colors adds cognitive load.

3. **What are the ranges of the variables?**
   Provides context for understanding relationships and order of magnitude.

4. **What does the appearance tell you about the relationships between the variables?**
   The key takeaway - why are you including this visualization?

:::

## The Four-Levels Model {.smaller}

Lundgard and Satyanarayan (2021) categorized meaningful alt text into four levels:

- **Level 1**: Elemental and encoded properties (title, legend, axis names, chart type)
- **Level 2**: Statistical concepts and relations (mean, median, range, quantitative relations)
- **Level 3**: Perceptual and cognitive phenomena (trends, outliers, patterns)
- **Level 4**: Contextual and domain-specific insights (interpretations, causation)

. . .

Alt texts should be long enough to include **Level 2 and Level 3** information, not just Level 1.

## Alt and surrounding text {.smaller}

```         
"CHART TYPE of TYPE OF DATA where REASON FOR INCLUDING CHART`

+ Link to data source somewhere in the text
```

. . .

-   `CHART TYPE`: It's helpful for people with partial sight to know what chart type it is and gives context for understanding the rest of the visual.

. . .

-   `TYPE OF DATA`: What data is included in the chart? The x and y axis labels may help you figure this out.

. . .

-   `REASON FOR INCLUDING CHART`: Think about why you're including this visual. What does it show that's meaningful. There should be a point to every visual and you should tell people what to look for.

. . .

-   `Link to data source`: Don't include this in your alt text, but it should be included somewhere in the surrounding text.

#|   beginning with $40K, up to $120K. The horizontal axis is labelled "Year",
#|   beginning with couple years before 2000 up to 2020. The following numbers are
#|   all approximate. In the graph, the California line begins around $50K in 1998
#|   and goes up to  $120K in 2020. The increase is steady, except for stalling for
#|   about couple years between 2015 to 2017. The New York line also starts around
#|   $50K, just below where the California line starts, and steadily goes up to $90K.

Scatter plots are among the more difficult graphs to describe, especially if there is a need to make specific data point accessible.

-   Identify the image as a scatter plot
-   Provide the title and axis labels
-   Focus on the overall trend
-   If it's necessary to be more specific, convert the data into an accessible table

## Adding alt text to plots

-   Short:

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| fig-alt: Alt text goes here.
# code for plot goes here
```

-   Longer:

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| fig-alt: |
#|   Longer alt text goes here. Make sure to add line breaks
#|   ~roughly 80 characters.
# code for plot goes here
```

## Context matters for alt text {.smaller}

The same chart can have different valid alt texts depending on context:

1. **"Line chart."** - If appearing in a chart-picker interface

2. **"A line chart with five lines, titled Product Performance in 2021."** - In a design mockup

3. **"Line chart. Product Performance in 2021. Product A is outperforming all other products."** - For a decision-maker

4. **"Line chart. Product Performance in 2021. All products trended down sharply from January until June and slowly stabilized back into positive territory by November."** - For analysts interested in trends

. . .

Only a human author understands why they've made something and what their audience should know.

## Strategies for writing good alt text {.smaller}

- **Describe meaningful aspects** - Tell the user the most important feature and what they should take away

- **Include quantitative data** - If there's a specific data point to highlight, include it

- **Remain brief and to the point** - If you need to describe every data point, provide a table elsewhere

- **Limit symbols** - Vertical bars, slashes, colons, and semicolons are voiced by screen readers. Write "x divided by y" instead of "x/y"

- **Limit URLs** - They are not activatable in alt text. Spell out "dot com" if needed

- **Avoid repeating chart titles** - If the title is in surrounding text, don't repeat it in alt text

## Tooling

Both of these are good examples, though not actively maintained: 

-  **ggalttext:** An R package for writing alt text for ggplot2 visualizations -- <https://nrennie.rbind.io/ggalttext/>.

-  **Ra11y:** collection of accessibilty features for ggplot2 charts --  <https://github.com/nicucalcea/Ra11y>.

And, of course, AI!

## Automatic alt text limitations {.smaller}

Machine learning tools for generating alt text:

- Can extract **Level 1** information (chart type, title, axis labels)
- Can sometimes extract **Level 2** information (some statistical facts)
- **Cannot** produce **Level 3** information (trends, patterns, meaning)
- **Cannot** produce **Level 4** information (context, interpretation)

. . .

> "For the foreseeable future, automatic alt texts will be incomplete. They can be used as a starting point... but these partial alt texts should be avoided altogether or edited to add Level 2 and 3 information."

## Testing for colorblind friendliness

-   Best way to test is with users (or collaborators) who have these color deficiencies

-   Simulation software also helps, e.g. Sim Daltonism for [Mac](https://michelf.ca/projects/sim-daltonism/) and [PC](https://pcmacstore.com/en/app/693112260/sim-daltonism)

## Color contrast I

-   Background and foreground text should have sufficient contrast to be distinguishable by users with different vision

-   Web app for checking color contrast checking: [Colour Contrast Analyser](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/)

## Color contrast II

A WIP R package for checking for color contrast: [**coloratio**](https://matt-dray.github.io/coloratio)

```{r}
cr_get_ratio("black", "white")
cr_get_ratio("#FFFFFF", "#000000")
cr_get_ratio("black", "gray10")
```

## Double encoding

Use shape *and* color where possible

# Accessibility and fonts

## Accessibility and fonts

-   Use a font that has been tested for accessibility (e.g., [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible))

-   Keep plot labels and annotations similarly sized as the rest of your text (e.g., `ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_minimal(base_size = 16))`)

# Beyond visual disabilities

## Who has disabilities? {.smaller}

Accessibility in visualization often focuses on visual disabilities (color vision deficiency, blindness, low vision), but data visualizations can create barriers for people with:

- **Cognitive disabilities** - affecting memory, attention, problem-solving
- **Motor and dexterity disabilities** - affecting interaction with visualizations
- **Vestibular disabilities** - sensitivity to motion and animation
- **Neurological disabilities** - affecting processing of visual information

. . .

> "Not everyone with disabilities will encounter barriers with data visualizations, but I want to encourage you to consider that most people with disabilities might."

> -- Frank Elavsky, *The Right Tools for the Job: Learning and Building for Data Visualization and Accessibility*

# Cognitive load and accessibility

## Cognitive Load Theory {.smaller}

::: incremental
- Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) helps us consider mental processing when creating visualizations.

- Two types of cognitive load:
  - **Intrinsic load**: The inherent nature of the information, refined to its bare minimum
  - **Extraneous load**: How the information is structured and presented

- Goal: Optimize intrinsic load and reduce extraneous load to fit the visualization within the capacity of working memory.
:::

::: aside
Source: Do No Harm Guide, Chapter 3: Designing Data for Cognitive Load
:::

## CLT principles for data visualization {.smaller}

- **Multimedia principle**: Use words and pictures because both are more effective than words alone. Readers are more likely to remember data presented as a chart rather than a dense table.

- **Contiguity principle**: Present words and pictures simultaneously rather than successively, e.g., via direct labeling.

- **Coherence principle**: Exclude extraneous words, sounds, or pictures. Adding unnecessary labels or visual distractors reduces the speed with which a reader comprehends and retains information.

- **Interactivity principle:** Allow learners to control the presentation rate, e.g., in animations.

- **Signaling principle:** Emphasize key steps in the representation, e.g., by highlighting and annotation.

## Animation considerations {.smaller}

If you use animations in visualizations:

1. **Reduce the number of animated elements** to reduce cognitive load on working memory

2. **Ensure animating objects move in a similar pattern** to one another or reduce the number of animated objects

3. **Announce or describe animations for blind readers** by usings descriptions or ARIA live attributes for screen reader users

# Other approaches to accessibility

## Data sonification

Data sonification is the presentation of data as sound, i.e., auditory equivalent of data visualization.

Example: <http://playitbyr.org/gettingstarted.html#Idea>

## Data physicalization / haptics

Data physicalization is the presentation of data as objects you can touch, i.e., sensory equivalent of data visualization.
