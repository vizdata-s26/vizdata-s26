We will use R and Python in this course and use Positron as our IDE.
You will also need Git.

## Option 1 - Local installation

1. Dowload and install R: Follow these steps if you do not already have R installed or you need to update your version.

    - Go to <https://cran.r-project.org/>.
    - Download R 4.5.2 for your operating system.
    - Follow the installation instructions.

Steps for installing Python will be provided later in the course.

2. Install Positron: Follow these steps if you do not already have Positron installed or you need to update your version.

    - Go to <https://positron.posit.co/download.html>.
    - Accept the license agreement by checking the box.
    - Download Positron Positron-2026.01.0-147 for your operating system.
    - Follow the installation instructions.

3. Install Git: Follow these steps if you do not already have Git installed. You can check if Git is already installed by opening a shell (e.g., Terminal) and typing `which git` and/or `git --version`. 

    - If Git is installed, you will see the path to the Git executable and/or the version number. You're good to go!
    - If not, you might see an error message indicating that the command is not found, e.g., `git: command not found`. Follow the steps at <https://happygitwithr.com/install-git> for your operating system.

## Option 2 - Server access

If you are unable to install the software locally on your computer, you can use the departmental Posit workbench server at <https://rstudio.stat.duke.edu>.

Note that this requires Duke Net ID log in. Additionally, if you're not on the DukeBlue network, you will need to connect to [Duke's VPN](https://oit.duke.edu/service/vpn/).
